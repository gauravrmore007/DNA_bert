# DNA-BERT Sequence Alignment
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
DNA-BERT is a deep learning-based approach for genomic sequence alignment using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).
This project compares DNA-BERT with traditional sequence alignment methods like Smith-Waterman and BWA, demonstrating its ability to provide high accuracy at real-time speeds.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Fine-tuning DNA-BERT on synthetic genomic data
âœ… Benchmarking against Smith-Waterman & BWA
âœ… FastAPI Deployment for real-time alignment
âœ… Performance visualization & insights
